# Custom-Watermark!

**Do you fucking hate API Watermarks? Do they annoy the shit out of you?** **Don't hesitate!**

This repo was designed to overwrite watermarks that are really shitty and annoying! (kinda)

You can add your own watermark instead of 'Powered By WRD' or 'EasyExploits' or anything!

# How-to-use?

If the API has a console window - use `consolewtrmrk.cpp`!

If the API has a UI watermark - use `guiwtrmrk.cs` and `guiwtrmrk.lua`!

# Warnings!

Do not claim this is yours to prevent blacklist's from the API.

This does not affliate with any API developers or owners. Not official.

This was not made by the original devs, more like the flipped team of APIs.

This does not delete the APIs watermark as that is tragically not possible.
