# Custom-Watermark

**Do you fucking hate API Watermarks? Do they annoy the shit out of you?** **Don't hesitate!**

This repo was designed to overwrite watermarks that are really shitty and annoying! (kinda)

You can add your own watermark instead of 'Powered By WRD' or 'EasyExploits' or anything!

# How-to-use?

If the API has a console window - use `consolewtrmrk.cpp`!

If the API has a UI watermark - use `guiwtrmrk.cpp` and `guiwtrmrk.lua`!

If your API has none of these im sorry to say **skid failure.**
